          Currently, I am an Temporary Research and Teaching Attached (ATER)  in Statistics in Laboratory of Mathematics of Atlantic Brittany (LMBA, UMR CNRS 6205) at Université Bretagne Sud (UBS, Campus of Vannes), since September 2022.  Before, I was a Statistics postdoctoral researcher at Laboratoire de Mathématiques Raphael Salem at l'Université de Rouen. I received a Ph.D. in Statistic applied from the University Gaston Berger of Saint-Louis, Senegal in 2021, a thesis directed by A. Diop ( UGB, Saint-Louis) and Jean-François Dupuy ( INSA of Rennes, France)

          My research areas are machine learning and statistics. Primarily, my research is motivated by problems of zero inflation in count data commonly encountered in many fields such as health economics, environment and traffic safety. My current favorite research is on statistical inference (mathematical study: asymptotic properties in these models).  I am interested in both theoretical results and practical methods and their application to count data.
